## Concept
Creating a room where users with a spotify account can discover new or known genre's. During this period i would like to discover new music, i'm tired of my own routine. Thats why i come up with this idea to make a tag cloud from genre's. These genre's wil be extracted via the users currently played song or the recently played track.
