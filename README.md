# Real-Time Web @cmda-minor-web Â· 2019-2020

During this course you will learn how to build a **meaningful** real-time application. You will learn techniques to setup an open connection between the client and the server. This will enable you to send data in real-time both ways, at the same time.

## Concept
Creating a room where users with a spotify account can discover new or known genre's. During this period i would like to discover new music, i'm tired of my own routine. Thats why i come up with this idea to make a tag cloud from genre's. These genre's wil be extracted via the users currently played song or the recently played track.

## Installation
* Clone this repository to your computer.
* Use Terminal to navigate to this folder ```cd real-time-web-1920```.
* ```npm install``` to install the node modules.
* And then to run the application ```node server.js```.

scopes
endpoints
## Real Time Events

* Rooms with friends/ room codes.
